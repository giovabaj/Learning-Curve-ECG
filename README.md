# Sample size determination for deep learning models: applicability of learning curve fitting methods to ECG signal classification and prediction

Code to generate a learning curve for a convolutional neural network (CNN) model for ECG signal classification and prediction.

## Data 
The dataset used for the detection prediction can be found [here](https://physionet.org/content/challenge-2020/1.0.2/). It should be downloaded and unzipped in the folder `data/detection/original_data/` for the rest of computations.
The dataset for the prediction task cannot be publicly shared.
