Modifications to Dayimu et al., 2024 script (file gp_nls_scripts.R)
gp-functions:
- gp_model: Modified to allow specification of weights
            Modified to allow specification of number of chains, number of iterations,
            number of burn-in iterations and thinning
            Specified use of a mod_file with truncation of phi below at value 0.01
            (gp_mod_trunc.txt)
- predict_gp: modified so x_star can be specified by the user

nls-functions:
- nls_model: Modified in order to provide starting values
- predict_nls: Modified in order to specify predicted points

Modification to JAGS model file (file gp-mod_trunc.txt, required by gp-functions)
- distribution of phi truncated so that lower bound >=0.01:
  phi ~ dnorm(0, 0.1)T(0,) was changed to:
  phi ~ dnorm(0, 0.1)T(0.01,)

Modifications to Figueroa et al., 2012 script (file gp_nls_scripts.R)
- FitModel: Increased upper bound of b from 10 to 30
            Modified in order to print the estimated parameters
            Modified in order to return a summary of the predicted values
